# Trees

**A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.**

## Challenge

**understanding know how to impementet using the recursion**

## Approach & Efficiency

**i went with the recursion to solve it in order to reduce the line of codes and the Big O was**

```
time: O(n)
space: O(n)
```

## API

**the description are provided as a docstring in each method**
