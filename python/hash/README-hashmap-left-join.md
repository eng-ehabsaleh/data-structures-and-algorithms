# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps

- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

## Challenge

_We need to create a function which will loop through the hash table and combine the node data which inside the linked list which inside a list which inside in the bucket all of this node data will be combined in an array_

## Approach & Efficiency

Nested loops Loops

Big O:
